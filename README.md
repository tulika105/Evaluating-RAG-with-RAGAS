# RAG Pipeline Evaluation using RAGAS
This project implements and evaluates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using the RAGAS evaluation framework.

The system performs component-level evaluation of both:
 - Retriever
 - Generator
using structured metrics to assess retrieval quality, grounding, and semantic correctness.
